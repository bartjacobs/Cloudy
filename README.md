### Mastering Model-View-Viewmodel With Swift 3

#### Author: Bart Jacobs

In this [video course](http://courses.cocoacasts.com/p/mastering-model-view-viewmodel-with-swift-3), you learn the differences between Model-View-Controller and Model-View-ViewModel, highlighting the benefits Model-View-ViewModel has over Model-View-Controller.

After a short introduction, we take an application built with Model-View-Controller and refactor it to use Model-View-ViewModel. Along the way, you learn about the anatomy of view models, how to create them, and how to test them. We also add protocols to the mix to further simplify the view controllers in the project.

At the end of this course, you have the knowledge and hands-on experience to apply Model-View-ViewModel in your own projects.
